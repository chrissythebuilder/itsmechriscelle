        <h1> What 6 months of No Social Media Taught Me </h1>
        <h3> DECEMBER 2017 </h3>
        <div id="words1">
        <p> I knew I had to take action with this addiction of wanting to build my brand and widening my network by updating my feed and going through all the trending posts to keep myself polished when communicating with my peers. Now my habit of checking my phone first thing in the morning and right before I sleep was not something I was proud of because it almost felt like the device was a part of my physical being. It felt wrong and I was letting it take over my routine. Knowing that my life is just starting to form as I am in my early 20s and just landed my first job post-University, I have other priorities to juggle and technology is disrupting my momentum and more importantly, I was itching to just detach myself from the world - its expectations and requirements to increase social capital. It was a day in June where everything came tumbling down that I decided to just deactivate my Facebook and Instagram accounts. </p>

        <p> Initially there were some withdrawals of well.. wanting to curate my photography feed and staying in touch with my international friends but then I realized that there are other ways for me to fulfill those. I can build my stock photos so when I come back I could have them ready or I could open a new IG account just for photography. I have made a new email account dedicated to staying in touch with long-distance friends. I have listed 4 biggest lessons I have learned </p>

        <p> <strong> <center> it's a big world after all </center> </strong> </p>

        <p> I always hear about how small the world is and that's what I have always believed in especially with social media bringing people together in a more efficient manner. Having unplugged myself, my intention was to not only to get to know myself better but also the world as well. We live in this vast space where there are boundless opportunities to take, breathtaking experiences that took my breath away and unique personalities of people that I have encountered whose stories are just remarkable. There is so much to know and the only way to live, in my opinion, is to take situation as chapters and not as a prerequisite or continuum. The best way to measure one's life is to trace the dots backward not meticulously planning the details of tomorrow. For the past 6 months I was offline, I took some evening classes, rekindled some old friendships, and spent more time in understanding who I want to become.</p>

        <p> <strong> <center> not every person you created memories with should stay for the long run </center> </strong> </p>

        <p> Things happen and people change. </p>

Curabitur pharetra ut diam vitae rhoncus. Nunc vel tincidunt est. Sed vehicula eros a sapien rutrum, rhoncus facilisis nibh pellentesque. Donec non volutpat purus.

Praesent semper urna sed felis dictum consectetur. </p>

        <p> <strong> <center> life truly is better offline </center> </strong> </p>

        <p> My conversations with my friends used to revolve around what they saw in my social media account like "Oh I saw that you were in XYZ, how was that?" but without social media, we start with "What have you been up to?", which then feels more raw because they get to witness or hear about my story firsthand. We get to tackle the awkwardness head on and this way there is more room to work around such as asking more probing questions. This honestly takes a longer time to get to know someone but this allows depth because of the effort that is involved in getting to know someone. </p>
