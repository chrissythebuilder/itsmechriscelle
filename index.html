          Hi, my name is Chriscelle. I was born and raised in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNgEHFDYzo">beautiful archipelago of the Philippines</a> and currently living in Canada. I graduated from York University with a Bachelor's Degree in Human Resources Management and currently work as a <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/chriscelledlc001"> Technical Recruiter </a>. I envision the future of work as a space of inclusivity, curiosity, and compassion. In addition to my multidimensional self: I am gradually curating myself to become an excellent developer as I am pacing myself through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp</a> as well as completing George Brown's Certificate of Web Design and Development. I am working towards becoming a future engineer in the tech space where I aspire to build collaborative digital environments for human beings to thrive as a community, more than just independent entities.

          <br /> <br />

          If not in front of my laptop or working downtown, you will see me food hopping in the West side of the city, <a href="https://mydiscoveryofwonders.wordpress.com/"> writing about sociological/psychological realizations</a>, playing my keyboards, learning the guitar, playing boardgames, reading a book or strolling anywhere and everywhere to take pictures. I have the travel bug and have been to 11 countries (and still counting). I love to try new cuisines, watch broadway, and take part of history walks to understand different societies.

          <br /> <br />

          My ulitmate goal is to live everyday with an intention to build a better tomorrow for myself and the world whether that involves my daily interaction with people and nature or taking a break to energize my mind, body, and soul.</p>
