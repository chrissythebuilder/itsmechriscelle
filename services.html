        <h1> Application Development - Landing Page </h1>
        <p> Do you have a small business and would want your customers to be able to find you online? Do you have a non-profit organization you would want to build a website for your members to know what you're all about? Do you have an upcoming conference that you would want to get some attention to gather some volunteers and peak interests of potential participants? <br />  <br /> I'm your gal! I am offering a <strong> FREE </strong> service to my first 3 clients, mainly because I believe that I want to start where I get to fully understand my intention when building on projects that. Just fill up this <a href="">form</a> for me so that I can better assess if I will be the best person to meet and even exceed your expectations. I will get back to you in 3-4 business days. </p>

        <h1> Career / Life Coaching </h1>
        <p> When people ask me why I chose this career, my main motivation is to be part of the process of seeing individuals bring out their best versions despite several circumstances. </p>
        My experiences compose of the following:
          <ul>
            <li> Director of Talent Management at AIESEC YorkU</li>
            <li> National Trainer at AIESEC Canada </li>
            <li> Peer Mentor/Coach for New College at York University</li>
            <li> Career Services Coordinator at Lighthouse Labs </li>
            <li> Technical Recruiter at Lannick Technology </li>
          </ul>
        <br /> <p> My services do not represent my current employer rather a total composition of all my learnings across all my experiences in both my career and life.
